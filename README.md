# Minecraft Mods Notification in Telegram
This bot can notify you when a new minecraft mod was released

This bot was created as a learning tool to learn how to use the different libraries and to synchronize with Telegram to receive notifications to a specific group or chat. If you want to help me to continue improving it, you can make a commit, in this way I will be able to see better ways to develop it and improve my learning.
